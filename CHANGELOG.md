- Changed: minimum required Node.js version is `8.9.0`.
- Changed: emit warning by default on no plugins for `imagemin`.
- Feature: simple configuration using `String` or `Array`, for example `{ imageminOptions: { plugins: ['mozjpeg']}}` or `{ imageminOptions: { plugins: [['mozjpeg', { quality: 60 ]]}}`.
- Fixed: fallback for cache directory when it can't be resolved.

- Fixed: optimize all images in multi compiler mode.

## 4.0.1 - 2018-11-14

- Fixed: don't add multiple `imagemin-loader` in multi compiler mode by default.
- Fixed: don't interpolate asset module name when `loader` is disabled (also don't include their in `manifest` option).

## 4.0.0 - 2018-11-13

- Changed: change export `ImageminPlugin` and `imageminLoader` (Look on [Usage](https://github.com/itgalaxy/imagemin-webpack#usage)).

- Fixed: default `maxConcurrency` value on system where `os.cpus()` is unavailable.
- Fixed: performance in some cases.

## 3.0.0 - 2018-04-17

- Added: `cache` options (i.e. persistent cache), by default is `false` (because it is good practice to disable `cache` by default).
- Changed: `imagemin-loader` now dynamically added in loaders list as `pre` loader (i.e. no need setup `imagemin-loader` in `webpack.config.js`).
- Changed: use `webpack` errors and warnings `api`.
- Changed: `imagemin` plugins for `loader` should be placed in `imageminOptions` options (look example in `README.md`).
- Chore: refactor all plugin code (all source code now in `src` directory).
- Deleted: `excludeChunksAssets` options (use `loader` options for plugin instead).
- Fixed: use `maxConcurrency`, use `os.cpus().length - 1` for multi core systems and `1` for single core system.
- Fixed: don't add same file paths in `manifest`.

## 2.0.0 - 2018-02-28

- Changed: use `ModuleFilenameHelpers.matchObject` for `test` option (only `regex` now allowed).
- Changed: Drop support for `node` v4.
